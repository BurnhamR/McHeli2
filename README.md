## Warning, This project is mostly abandoned, This was all done by some community members when they had time, and most of them have been overly busy with school.
However this does not mean we may not come back to this.

# Aviation Mod
Welcome all to my project for an updated and advanced version of "McHeli by EMB4" made for 1.18-1.19+

This Repo was previously for the 1.12.2 port of McHeli but since then a large portion of the mod development has moved to 1.18, 1.19.
We have developers who work for many other popular mods on our team, and many developers are currently working on updating their own mods(HBM and Vics) to newer 1.18+ versions, so we moved our mod development to 1.18+.

The beta version of the 1.12.2 version is available in the discussions tab.

Expected Finish Date: Unknown

the Mod isn't updated/worked on majorly frequently due to many of the developers having their own projects and being busy with their personal lives.

The repository may/will not be updated! All actual updates are posted in our private repo!
